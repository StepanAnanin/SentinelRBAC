## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

SentinelRBAC is library for authorization, it helps you as a developer to define users permissions in your application.

### ROLES

Each role consist of 2 parts: name and default permissions for this role.

There are no built-in roles, all roles must be defined by developer.

### PERMISSIONS

There are 8 permissions:

-   Create

-   Self Create

-   Read

-   Self Read

-   Update

-   Self Update

-   Delete

-   Self Delete

I assume that there are no need to describe what each one of them permit to do.

### Entity

Entity is a subject wich will be authorized to perform actions on a specific resources.

In most cases you will have only 1 entity in your application - user.

### Action

Action is just a custom typed string wich represents name of this action. Each action is bound to specific entity.

Action can be create via `.NewAction(<name>, <required permissions>)` method of some entity.

### Resource

Resource is an object on wich action is supposed to be performed. Resource contains allowed permissions for each role,
so it provide more flexiblility in permissions configurations.

### Authorization

To authorize some action you need 4 things: roles, entity, action itself and resource.

Example:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	rbac "github.com/StepanAnanin/SentinelRBAC"
)

func main() {
	roles := []*rbac.Role{
		rbac.NewRole("admin", &rbac.Permissions{
			Delete: false,
		}),
		rbac.NewRole("moderator", &rbac.Permissions{
			Delete: false,
		}),
		rbac.NewRole("user", &rbac.Permissions{
			Delete: false,
		}),
	}

    // admin
	userRoles1 := roles[:1]
    // moderator, user
	userRoles2 := roles[1:]

	user := rbac.NewEntity("user")

    // This is required permissions for this action
	act := user.NewAction("delete", &rbac.Permissions{
		Delete: true,
	})

    // Resources contains roles (and roles contains allowed permissions)
	cache := rbac.NewResource("cache", roles)

    // Inside of resource you can change role permissions as it requires
    // It won't affect original roles, cuz each resource uses a copy of roles' permissions.
	cache.Permissions["admin"].Delete = true

	e := rbac.Authorize(act, cache, rbac.GetRolesNames(userRoles1))

    // Error: <nil>
	fmt.Println(e)

	e = rbac.Authorize(act, cache, rbac.GetRolesNames(userRoles2))

    // Error: Insufficient permissions to perform this action
	fmt.Println(e)

    // (0 index is "admin" role)
    // false, even if previously it was set to true,
    // this change doesn't affect original or other resource's roles permissions,
	fmt.Println(roles[0].Permissions.Delete)
}
```

## Host

`Host` originaly desined for applications with microservice architectures.

`Host` helps to define roles and schemas for each service in your app.
Roles can be specified by default or schemas can have their own roles.

> [!NOTE]
> Service specific roles will overwrite default roles!

You can also select one of default roles as origin role, all new users must have this role in your application.

`Host` can be initialized by one of the following methods:

-   **LoadHost(path string)** - Open and reads configuration file (JSON) at the specified path and after parsing returns it. This method also validates permissions and merges default roles with service specific roles, so consider this method as recommended way of `Host` initialization.

### HOST EXAMPLE

```json

    "origing-role": "unconfirmed_user",
    "default-roles": [
        {
